{"name":"Dota Hero Select","tagline":"Center your Dota 2 screen with ease.","body":"What?\r\n======\r\nThis is a very simple script that makes jumping back to your hero a bit easier; it simply binds to the default \"F1\" key that Dota 2 sets for selecting your hero. Just middle click and you're screen is re-centered on your hero.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n====\r\n- Makes multitasking around the map a bit easier.\r\n- Aids players who are beginning to learn \"micro\" skills.\r\n- Players are used to using the mouse to navigate withing the game as opposed to the keyboard.\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n============\r\n- Run this application alongside with Dota 2 (preferably before you start the game up).\r\n- Click your mouse's middle button (the scroll wheel on most mice).\r\n    - The screen will center on your hero.\r\n    - You hero will now be selected.\r\n        - When used on Meepo or illusions, the screen will center on the \"true\" hero.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
